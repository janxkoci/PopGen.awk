# PopGen.awk
Collection of awk scripts for population &amp; evolutionary genetics. Maybe a library later.

**Note:** Some scripts may be optimized for diferent _flavours_ of awk (like mawk, or bioawk). Some may _require_ a particular flavour (like gawk or bioawk). I will do my best to make clear which awk flavour should be used with each script. For now, I typically use the shebang and sometimes file extension to indicate an awk flavour.
